# bacteria

We created a dashboard to show demographic information and to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. The volunteers are able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
